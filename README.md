## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **waste detection using instance segmentation** with modern YOLO-based segmentation models.  
To reduce the dependency on expensive pixel-level annotations, we apply **Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL)** techniques that leverage both labeled and unlabeled data.

We compare:
- Supervised baseline models
- Semi-supervised learning methods under a fixed dataset split protocol
